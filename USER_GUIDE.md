- **Change Description**: Detailed explanation of what will be changed
- **Reason for Change**: Business justification and drivers
- **Change Type**: Normal or Emergency
- **Requester**: Person requesting the change
- **Assigned Agent**: IT agent responsible for coordination

**Best Practices**:
- Use clear, non-technical language for business stakeholders
- Include specific system names and versions
- Reference related tickets or incidents if applicable

#### Step 2: Asset Association
**Purpose**: Identify all systems and assets impacted by the change

**Process**:
1. **Search for Assets**: Use the asset search functionality
2. **Select Impacted Assets**: Choose all systems that will be directly affected
3. **Review Asset Details**: Verify technical owners and dependencies
4. **Add Related Assets**: Include any dependent systems

**Asset Information Captured**:
- Asset name and type
- Technical owner/manager
- Location and department
- Current status and configuration

**Impact Analysis**:
- **Direct Assets**: Systems being directly modified
- **Related Assets**: Systems with dependencies
- **Technical Owners**: Automatically identified from asset management
- **Stakeholders**: Users and managers of impacted systems

#### Step 3: Risk Assessment
**Purpose**: Evaluate the risk level of the proposed change

**Risk Factors** (1-3 scale each):
1. **Business Impact**: Effect on business operations
   - 1: Minimal impact, isolated system
   - 2: Moderate impact, affects department
   - 3: High impact, affects multiple departments/customers

2. **Affected Users**: Number of users impacted
   - 1: <10 users
   - 2: 10-100 users
   - 3: >100 users

3. **Complexity**: Technical complexity of the change
   - 1: Simple, routine change
   - 2: Moderate complexity, standard procedure
   - 3: Complex, involves multiple systems/teams

4. **Testing Level**: Extent of testing performed
   - 1: Comprehensive testing in production-like environment
   - 2: Limited testing, some risk present
   - 3: Minimal testing, high uncertainty

5. **Rollback Risk**: Difficulty of undoing the change
   - 1: Easy rollback, automated process
   - 2: Moderate rollback complexity
   - 3: Difficult rollback, potential data loss

**Risk Levels**:
- **Low Risk**: Total Score 5-7 (Standard approval process)
- **Medium Risk**: Total Score 8-11 (Peer review required)
- **High Risk**: Total Score 12-15 (Enhanced oversight required)

#### Step 4: Implementation Planning

### Approval Workflow Procedures

#### Risk-Based Status Assignment
Upon submission, changes are assigned an initial status based on risk level:

**Low Risk Changes (Score 5-7)**:
- **Initial Status**: "Pending Approval"
- **Immediate Action**: Technical owner approval tickets created
- **Process**: Standard approval workflow begins immediately

**Medium/High Risk Changes (Score 8-15)**:
- **Initial Status**: "Pending Review"  
- **Immediate Action**: Peer review coordination task created
- **Process**: Must complete peer review before moving to approval phase

#### Standard Approval Process (Low Risk)
1. **Automatic Stakeholder Identification**: System identifies technical owners and stakeholders
2. **Status Assignment**: Change status set to "Pending Approval"
3. **Approval Ticket Creation**: Individual approval tickets created for each technical owner
4. **Stakeholder Notification**: Notification sent to all impacted stakeholders
5. **Parallel Approvals**: All approvals processed simultaneously
6. **Status Update**: When all approvals received, status changes to "Scheduled"

#### Peer Review Coordination Process (Medium/High Risk)
**Triggered For**: Medium and High risk changes (score ≥ 8)

**Phase 1: Peer Review (Status: "Pending Review")**:
1. **SME Assignment**: Agent SME identified (assigned agent → technical owner → asset manager)
2. **Coordination Task**: Task created for SME to coordinate peer review
3. **SME Options**:
   - Assign to qualified peer reviewer (different from requester and SME)
   - Coordinate external review and attach evidence
   - Escalate for appropriate reviewer assignment
4. **Review Completion**: SME provides evidence of completed review
5. **Documentation**: Review findings attached to change request

**Phase 2: Workflow Automation Trigger**:

4. **CAB Escalation**: For high risk changes, additional CAB approvals are created

**Phase 3: Approval Process (Status: "Pending Approval")**:
1. **Technical Owner Approvals**: Standard approval process begins
2. **CAB Review**: High risk changes include Change Advisory Board approval
3. **Parallel Processing**: All approvals processed simultaneously
4. **Final Status**: When all approvals received, status changes to "Scheduled"

#### Escalation Procedures
**Escalation Triggers**:
- Approval not received within defined timeframes
- Conflicting approvals or recommendations
- Technical disagreement on implementation approach
- Risk assessment disputes

**Escalation Process**:
1. **Automatic Escalation**: System escalates overdue approvals
